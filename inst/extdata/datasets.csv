# This tab-separated file contains meta-data about all the individual data sets
# provided by the s-shaped-curves package (as well as a TODO list of data sets
# that still need to be added, see the end of this file).
# 
# The scurves() command from the package simply returns this file read in using the following command:
# read.table('datasets.csv', header=TRUE, sep='\t')

# This file specifies the following columns:
#
# id: character string, a dataset identifier comprised of an 'alpha' citation
#     style id of the paper in which the data was originally published, followed
#     by an optional specifier (particularly for publications which contain more than one dataset). the relevant data can be loaded from a tab-separated file of the same name with a .csv extension in this directory.
# type: factor, specifying whether the variable of the given dataset is
#       syn(tactic), morph(ological) or phon(etic|ological)
# nvariants: numeric, the number of competing variants (2 or more)
# ncontexts: the number of distinct contexts reported in the data set, this
#            is the same as the number of levels of the dataset's context column
# realtime: logical, whether data was obtained in real time (vs. apparent time)
# description: some brief human-readable description of the change
# variants: character string listing shorthands for all competing variants,
#           separated by spaces, with the outgoing variant first, followed by
#           the successful incoming variant and any other competing variants.
# bibkey: bibtex key of the paper from which the dataset was extracted
